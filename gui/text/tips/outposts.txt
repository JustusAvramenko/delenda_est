OUTPOSTS
Build with a Scout Cavalry in neutral territory for a large vision range.
Cheap, at 80 Wood.
They construct quickly, but are weak.
Lose loyalty while in neutral territory, but are recapturable.
Upgrade to 'Stone Outpost' for 50 stone in Town Phase, which adds health and removes territory decay.
