PHALANX FORMATION
- A strong tight formation for Greek "hoplite" style spear infantry.

- Strong armor from the front, plus a trample damage charge attack.

- Armor penalty from the rear and movement speed reduced by 20%.

- Most require researching the 'Othismos' technology to unlock it, but Spartans have it available for free.
