FARMLAND
- Build farm fields on farmland terrain to gather grain much quicker than normal.

- On the other hand, because of the 'Civic Spaces' farming penalty, farm fields built around Civic Centers and Temples gather half as fast as normal.

- Purchase Slaves at the Farmstead, who are excellent farmers.
