SCOUT CAVALRY
- A starting unit for each faction.

- Scouts are good for scouting because of their fast speed and large vision range.

- They are also the player's best hunters in the very early game before the availability of ranged cavalry.

- Only 2 can be alive at once while still in Village Phase.
