PIKE INFANTRY
- Heavily armored and slow. Low attack.

- Use against cavalry for a 2x attack bonus or against other melee infantry to pin them in place.

- "Massed Pikes" aura gives a small but stackable (the more pikes nearby, the greater the affect) attack boost to other nearby pike infantry.

- Available to: Epirotes, Macedonians, Seleucids, and Ptolemies.
