DEFENSE TOWERS
- Free-standing towers that automatically fire arrows at nearby enemies.

- Start as weak wooden towers in Village Phase, but can be upgraded to stronger stone towers in Town Phase, at 100 stone for each tower.

- Garrison more ranged troops inside to increase the number of arrows it fires.
