RESOURCE GATHERING
- Citizens can gather, but are best at building. Slaves are good gatherers, but cannot build anything.

- Foraging from berry bushes or berry trees is the fastest way to gather food, while farming is the slowest. Food is required for most units.

- Mine stone from quarries to build military and defensive structures.

- Mine metal from metal mines to research improvements and train strong soldiers.

- Use the "Town Bell" at a Storehouse or Farmstead to hide nearby Slaves from an attack.
