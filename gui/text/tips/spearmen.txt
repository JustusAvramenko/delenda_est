SPEAR INFANTRY
The basic melee infantry for most factions in the game.
Used against cavalry for a 1.5x attack bonus.
Decent hack attack and a good charge bonus make them good front line troops.
They are countered by ranged units and sword infantry, so support your spear infantry with slingers or cavalry.
