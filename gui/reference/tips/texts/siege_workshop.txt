SIEGE ARSENAL
Build these to construct Siege Weapons and research their improvements.
These types of Siege Weapons can be constructed here: Battering Ram, Bolt Shooter and Fire Raiser.
Building an Arsenal also unlocks the ability for soldiers to build Catapults and Siege Towers for some factions.
Not every faction will have access to every type of Siege Weapon. They are faction-specific.
