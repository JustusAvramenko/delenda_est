PIKE INFANTRY
Heavily armored and slow. Low attack.
Available by default to Epirotes, Macedonians, Seleucids, Kushites, and Ptolemies. Unlocked for the Spartans if the Hero Cleomenes III is chosen by the player.
Use against cavalry for a 2x attack bonus or against other melee infantry to pin them in place.
"Massed Pikes" aura: A small but stackable (the more pikes nearby, the greater the affect) attack boost to other nearby pike infantry plus a small non-stackable boost in armor.
