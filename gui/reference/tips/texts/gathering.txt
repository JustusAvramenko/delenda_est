RESOURCE GATHERING
Citizens can gather, but are best at building. Slaves are good gatherers, but cannot build anything.
Foraging from berry bushes is the fastest way to gather food, while farming is the slowest. Food is required for most units.
Wood can be lumbered from trees or forest groves and is used for basic structures and training soldiers.
Mine stone from rock quarries to build military and defensive structures.
Mine metal from metal mines to research technologies and train sword-wielding soldiers.
