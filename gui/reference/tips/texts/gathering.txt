RESOURCE GATHERING
Citizens can gather, but are best at building. Slaves are good gatherers, but cannot build anything.
Foraging from berry bushes or berry trees is the fastest way to gather food, while farming is the slowest. Food is required for most units.
Mine stone from quarries to build military and defensive structures.
Mine metal from metal mines to research improvements and train strong soldiers.
Use the "Town Bell" at a Storehouse or Farmstead to hide nearby Slaves from an attack.
