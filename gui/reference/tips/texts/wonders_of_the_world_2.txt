WONDERS OF THE WORLD
Some maps have freestanding and unclaimed Wonders, which can be captured and held to win a Wonder victory.
These Wonders are indestructible, so can be captured over and over again.
Since they are Wonders, they can trigger the Empire phase for the owner, but do not prevent the owner from building their faction's own Wonder.
Some Wonders represented: Athena Parthenos, The Colossus of Rhodes, The Lighthouse of Alexandria, Stonehenge, and The Uffington White Horse.
