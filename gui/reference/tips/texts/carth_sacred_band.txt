CARTHAGINIAN SACRED BAND
Champion Spearmen and Champion Cavalry Spearmen for Carthage.
Both cost food and coin and are trainable from the Temple, instead of the Fortress like most other champions.
Use the spearmen as heavy infantry against cavalry. Use the cavalry as heavy shock against siege weapons and skirmishers.
