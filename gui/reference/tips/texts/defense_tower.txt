DEFENSE TOWERS
Free-standing towers that automatically fire arrows at nearby enemies.
Start as weak wooden towers in Village Phase, but can be upgraded to stronger stone towers in Town Phase, at 100 stone for each tower upgrade.
Garrison more ranged troops inside to increase the number of arrows it fires.
