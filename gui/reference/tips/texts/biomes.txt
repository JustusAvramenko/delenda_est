BIOMES
Biomes can be used on some random maps to determine which region of the world the map represents.
They influence the appearence of the maps and also the available amount of different resources.
For example, the Sahara biome has less wood, but more metal and stone. While the India biome has an abundance of wood and animals, but less metal and stone.
