	"History":"The great power of Central Greece and leader of the Boeotian confederacy, Thebes is a force to be reckoned with. It is a major rival of ancient Athens, and sided with the Persians during the 480 BC invasion under Xerxes. Theban forces ended the power of Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC under the command of Epaminondas. The Sacred Band of Thebes (an elite military unit) famously fell at the battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC against Philip II and Alexander the Great. Prior to its destruction by Alexander in 335 BC, Thebes was a major force in Greek history, and was the most dominant city-state at the time of the Macedonian conquest of Greece.",

Later he accompanied his friend and co-Boeotarch, Epaminondas, in defeating the Spartans at the Battle of Leuktra using the novel Oblique Order phalanx formation, focusing their forces on one part of the Spartan line in order to break it and route the rest of the enemy army. At the end of his life, Pelopidas was called upon by the towns of Thessaly to protect them against the rising ambitions of Alexander of Pharae. He managed to defeat Alexander, but in his haste to strike the final blow on Alexander, Pelopidas was himself slain."

Plutarch in his Life of Pelopidas credits Gorgidas with the creation of the Sacred Band, which he dispersed at first throughout the front ranks of the regular infantry, with the idea that they would inspire valour; however they were later arrayed by Pelopidas as a unit in order to make their gallantry more conspicuous."

			"Name":"Oblique Order",
			"History":"The oblique order is a military tactic whereby an attacking army focuses its forces to attack a single enemy flank. The force commander concentrates the majority of his strength on one flank and uses the remainder to fix the enemy line. This allows a commander with weaker or equal forces to achieve a local superiority in numbers. The commander can then try to defeat the enemy in detail. It has been used by numerous successful generals. Oblique order required disciplined troops able to execute complex maneuvers in varied circumstances. The first recorded use of this tactic was at the Battle of Leuctra, in Greece, when the Thebans under Epaminondas defeated the Spartans by highly enforcing one flank to fifty rows deep, rather than spread forces parsimoniously. Philip of Macedon learned Epaminondas' technique while held prisoner at Thebes, and his descendants, including Alexander the Great, used it in their campaigns. The classical writer Vegetius was the first known to write about the tactic that became known as the oblique order of battle.",
