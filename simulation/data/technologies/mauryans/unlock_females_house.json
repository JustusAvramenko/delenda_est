	"genericName": "Tantric Fertility Festival",
	"description": "A festival attended by women-only, to celebrate female fertility. For example, the Thesmophoria was a festival held in Greek cities, in honor of the goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone. The name derives from thesmoi, or laws by which men must work the land. The Thesmophoria were the most widespread festivals and the main expression of the cult of Demeter, aside from the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Thesmophoria commemorated the third of the year when Demeter abstained from her role of goddess of the harvest and growth; spending the harsh summer months of Greece, when vegetation dies and lacks rain, in mourning for her daughter who was in the realm of the Underworld. Their distinctive feature was the sacrifice of pigs. Whereas Bona Dea (or The Good Goddess) was a divinity in ancient Roman religion. She was associated with chastity and fertility in women, healing, and the protection of the Roman state and people. Her rites allowed women the use of strong wine and blood-sacrifice, things otherwise forbidden them by Roman tradition. Men were barred from her mysteries and the possession of her true name. The goddess had two annual festivals. One was held at her Aventine temple and the other was hosted by the wife of Rome's senior annual magistrate, for an invited group of elite matrons and female attendants.",
