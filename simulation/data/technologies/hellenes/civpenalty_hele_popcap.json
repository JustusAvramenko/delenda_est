	"description": "Neither the Spartans, nor the Athenians, nor the Thebans had the largest armies in the world, but they did have the best armies in the world for their time. What they didn't have in quantity, they made up with quality. It was said that Sparta did not need strong city walls, for its men were its walls. Athens had a military training program for all male citizens that lasted over 2 years. And Thebes had the Sacred Band, 150 pairs of warriors trained and maintained by the state.",
