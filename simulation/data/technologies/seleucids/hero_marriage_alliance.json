	"description": "Seleucus I Nicator invaded the Punjab region of India in 305 BC, confronting Chandragupta Maurya (Sandrokottos), founder of the Mauryan empire. It is said that Chandragupta fielded an army of 600,000 men and 9,000 war elephants (Pliny, Natural History VI, 22.4). Seleucus met with no success and to establish peace between the two great powers and to formalize their alliance, he married his daughter to Chandragupta. In return, Chandragupta gifted Seleucus a corps of 500 war elephants, which would prove a decisive military asset for Seleucus as he fought the rest of Alexander's successors.",
