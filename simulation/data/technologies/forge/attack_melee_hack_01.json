	"description": "Often, a soldier would carry a secondary weapon in addition to his primary weapon of choice, to be drawn when the primary weapon has failed or been broken. The Greek “Xiphos” was a short sword with a leaf-shaped blade used primarily for hacking and stabbing. The Roman “Pugio” was a broad-bladed dagger, usually stored in an ornately decorated sheathe. The “Akinakes” had a short triangular-shaped blade and was wielded by high-ranking Scythians and Persians.",
