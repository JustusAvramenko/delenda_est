	"description": "Quenching is a heat treatment process that involves rapidly cooling a material after heating it to a high temperature. The purpose of quenching is to improve the mechanical properties of metals and alloys. Differential quenching, also known as differential hardening, selective quenching, or local hardening, is a heat treatment process that's used to make blades tougher while keeping the edge very hard and strong. This process is commonly used in bladesmithing. Differential quenching makes the spine of the blade soft and bendable, while the edge remains hard and sharp. This makes the blade resistant to breaking and wear, even during rough use.",
