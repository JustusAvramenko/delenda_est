Only the most celebrated soldiers had shields faced with silver, as did the famous “Silver Shields” regiment in Alexander the Great's army. Other polities, like Sparta, provided a state-issued shield to all of their soldiers, but in Sparta's case, only upon completion of the rigorous Spartan military training regimen, The Agoge.",
