    <History>The Thebans are a strong land power with access to the unique \"Fire Raiser\" siege weapon. Their hoplites utilize the strong phalanx formation and they receive 1 extra hoplite at the beginning of a standard match. They also receive a free Stoa building, which grants +20% health for all buildings, and the Greek Theater, which increases territory influence for their buildings.</History>
