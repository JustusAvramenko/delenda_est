    <History>The Yamatai, also known as the Yayoi, are the first people identified as the ancestors of the modern Japanese, although the Jomon and Ainu preceded them. They created a highly structured society which traded freely with Korea and China. They rely almost exclusively upon Infantry and cheap Buildings in order to compete against other factions.</History>
