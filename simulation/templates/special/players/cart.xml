    <History>The Carthaginians have the largest roster of mercenary units in the game, and can train them from 3 different barracks called Embassies, but conversely have limited access to cheaper citizen soldiers. Their walls are very strong and so is their navy, with access to the Quinquereme heavy warship and a sea trading bonus. They begin a standard match with 1 free Numidian Cavalry.</History>
