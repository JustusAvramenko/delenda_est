    <History>The largest migration in Europe of the B.C. period was that of the Cimbri people. The Cimbri were a large group of Germanic peoples originally from the Jutland region, in the north of modern-day Denmark. In the late 2nd century BC, their migration south into Italy and France would spark the decade-long Cimbrian War against the Roman Republic, bringing "Terror Germanicus" to the hearts of the Roman people.</History>
