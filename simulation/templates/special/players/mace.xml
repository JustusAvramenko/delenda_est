    <History>The Macedonians have access to pike infantry and a strong cavalry arm. Their champions and heroes are among the strongest in the game and they can build ranged siege weapons without having to research Ballistics. They receive a free Stoa building, which grants +20% health for all buildings, the Greek Theater, which increases territory influence, and the Library, which boosts technological research.</History>
