    <History>The Xiongnu are a nomadic faction with cheap, weak buildings which can be packed and moved to new areas. Their Women are capable hunters and part-time soldiers, and their Men are strong raiders and looters and full-time warriors. They start each skirmish map with a free Yurt, which helps their starting population limit, a free Wagon, which is a mobile dropsite, and a Warlord, a powerful champion.</History>
