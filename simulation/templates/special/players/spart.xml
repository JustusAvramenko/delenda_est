    <History>The Spartans have some of the strongest infantry in the game, with Perioikoi hoplites and Spartiate champions, who both utilize the strong phalanx formation. They also receive a free Stoa building, which grants +20% health for all buildings, and the Greek Theater, which increases territory influence for their buildings. Lastly, they receive 1 free Spartiate champion at the start of a standard match.</History>
