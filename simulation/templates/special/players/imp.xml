    <History>The Imperial, or Principate, Romans have a strong army, divided between Legions and Auxiliaries. They have a large technology tree and their wonder, the Flavian Aphitheater, aka The Colosseum, grants a large territory bonus while in the Empire phase. They have access to the Army Camp and Siege Walls, which can be built in enemy territory. They receive a free Temple of Vesta at the start of a match, which increases capture resistance of nearby buildings, and can build the Triumphal Arch, their Cult Statue, which also boosts their soldiers. Lastly, their navy is weak, but their siege weapons are very strong.</History>
