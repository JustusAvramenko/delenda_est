    <History>The Kushites are an African kingdom known for its vast wealth, so they start a standard match with an extra free metal mine near their Civic Center. Their archers are excellent and their units are fast-moving, but have low armor. They build Meroitic Pyramids, which increase the territory influence of their settlements and they have access to fast light war elephants.</History>
