    <History>The Maurya Indians have excellent archers and a large number of champions, including war elephants, chariots, macemen, and Maiden Archers, who can swap weapons between sword and longbow. Their citizen infantry are low quality and cavalry are mediocre, but train quickly. Like the Chinese and Persians, the Indians have a +10% population cap bonus. Lastly, the Pillars of Ashoka boost nearby citizens.</History>
