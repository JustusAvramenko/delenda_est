    <History>The Britons have weak buildings, but they build fast. Their farming is excellent, boosted by their Rotary Mill special building. They have access to war chariots and fierce war dogs, who are trained at the Kennel. They start each standard match with 1 free war dog at the elite level and can build Forges in village phase, earlier than most other factions.</History>
