    <History>The Gauls start each match with 1 free Druid priest, who can heal nearby units. They have weak buildings, but they build fast. Their warriors are fast-moving, but have lower armor than average. Their Rotary Mills boost farming rates, and combined with fast building help make the Gauls a good booming faction. Lastly, they can build forges in the village phase.</History>
