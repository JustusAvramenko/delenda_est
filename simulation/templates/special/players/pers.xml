    <History>The Achaemenid Persians are a strong land trading and economic faction. Their standard infantry units are weak, but train fast for massed armies, while their cavalry arm is excellent. They can train Immortals and heroes from the Apadana Palace building, and can research the full tree of building and defensive technologies. Lastly, they have a +10% population cap bonus.</History>
