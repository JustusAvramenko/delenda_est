    <History>The Iberians are the quintessential defensive faction, who start standard matches with a free circuit of defensive walls. They have good skirmishers and swordsmen and strong fortresses. Their Revered Monument boosts the attack of nearby soldiers and they can build forges in the village phase, earlier than most other factions.</History>
