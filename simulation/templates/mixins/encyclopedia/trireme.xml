    <History>During the 6th, 5th, and 4th centuries BC, Trierēs or Triremes were the most widely used warships throughout the Mediterranean. These ships featured three stacked rows of oarsmen on each side of the hull, with one rower manning each of the 170 oars. The typical Greek trireme was 100 to 115 feet long, with a 5-foot-long bronze or iron ram at the bow which was used to hole and sink enemy vessels. The trireme's design prioritized speed and maneuverability; with three rows of oars, they were significantly faster than earlier bireme and penteconter ships. Based on modern reconstructions, triremes likely achieved average speeds of 8 knots but could reach burst speeds up to 14 knots under optimal conditions. Agility and maneuverability were the decisive factors that made the trireme the defining warship of its era. For example, at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, a Greek fleet lead by the Athenian general Themistocles consisting mostly of triremes defeated a much larger invading Persian fleet. Thanks to the trireme's combination of swiftness, tight turning capability, and ramming proficiency, the Greek fleet managed to outmaneuver the Persians. Even as larger warships emerged, the trireme remained present in smaller numbers in many fleets through the Hellenistic age (4th to 1st century BC).
