Penteconters were developed around 800 BC and for their time were the most widely used ships throughout the Mediterranean Sea. As the Greek name "Pentēkóntoros" ("fifty-oared") suggests, they had 50 oars total, so 25 on each side. Penteconters averaged 12 feet in width and 100 feet in length, including a bronze naval ram at the bow. At that time, there was no distinction between warships and merchant ships; crews consisted of soldiers who fought aboard to defend the ship. Large-scale naval battles were rare, so penteconters mostly served as troop transports and merchant vessels.

Around the 7th century BC, biremes and triremes (faster ships with more oars) were developed, which replaced penteconters as the preferred warships in archaic and classical navies. Penteconters still continued to be used in lower numbers for trading since they required fewer rowers than the faster and larger ships and in the naval forces of smaller states.
