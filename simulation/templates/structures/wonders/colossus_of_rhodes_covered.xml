	<History>“To you, O Sun, the people of Dorian Rhodes set up this bronze statue reaching to Olympus, when they had pacified the waves of war and crowned their city with the spoils taken from the enemy. Not only over the seas but also on land did they kindle the lovely torch of freedom and independence. For to the descendants of Herakles belongs dominion over sea and land.”

Thus was the dedication text for the great colossal bronze statue situated near the mouth of the harbor of Rhodes. Constructed between 292 BC and 280 BC by the famed sculptor Chares of Lindos, the statue was a depiction of the god Helios, the patron deity of Rhodes.

The statue stood for 54 years until a 226 BC earthquake caused significant damage to large portions of Rhodes, including the harbor and commercial buildings. The statue snapped at the knees and fell over onto land. Ptolemy III offered to pay for the reconstruction of the statue, but the Oracle of Delphi made the Rhodians fear that they had offended Helios, and they declined to rebuild it.
