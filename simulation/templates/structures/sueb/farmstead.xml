    <History>Farming typically revolved around small hamlets and farmsteads with enclosed rectilinear fields - each having areas of pasture, farmland and wood. Ploughing became more efficient with the arrival of the iron share and a two field rotation was introduced; crops one year followed by a fallow that was grazed by livestock. This lead to surprisingly high yields and fuelled population growth. The image of a farmstead would most likely be a house with some out-buildings. Storage of crops was either in pits or in raised stores and harvest was over several months - weeds, grain and then straw.</History>
