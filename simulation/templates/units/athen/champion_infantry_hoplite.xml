    <History>In Athens, only 18- to 20-year-olds were obligated to actively take part in military training. However, should war break out, men up to the age of 60 could be called up to serve in the Athenian army. This meant Athens' hoplite force largely consisted of militias who lacked training and experience.
    
However, just as several other Greek city-states did, Athens maintained a small elite hoplite force of professional soldiers. They were called “Epilektoi” or “Logades” (both meaning "the chosen ones”). As the name implies, they were hand-picked for specific purposes. They could either be used to support the main hoplite body or carry out separate missions and special tasks that required fighting expertise. The “Epilektoi” actually made up only a small percentage of the, at their peak, more than 30,000 total Athenian hoplites, being reported by historical sources as being less than a thousand strong.

They were probably recruited from a bracket of wealthy Athenian citizens, as every soldier had to provide his own equipment consisting of a spear, a large round shield, and a short sword, which was quite expensive for the average citizen. Especially because they probably were, as an elite corps of trained professionals, expected to wear heavy (and expensive) body armor for maximum protection, unlike regular citizen hoplites.</History>
