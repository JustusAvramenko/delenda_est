    <History>Carthaginian citizen cavalry performed admirably during the invasion of Africa by Regulus in the First Punic War as well as during the Mercenary War afterwards. Citizen cavalry from other colonies, noted as Liby-Phoenicians by later authors, joined Hasdrubal in Spain during the Second Punic under orders from Hannibal. It is most likely they were from African colonies as Hannibal notes they were brought to Spain to ensure tight bonds between African cities and Spanish cities. Cavalry deployed by the Sardinian rebel Hampsicora in the Second Punic War against the Romans to try and bring the Carthaginians back to Sardinia may have been Phoenician cavalry either formed from Puno-Nuraghic nobles on the island or sent by Carthage itself to help Hampsicora’s efforts.</History>
