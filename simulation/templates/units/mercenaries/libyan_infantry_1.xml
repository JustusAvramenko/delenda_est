    <SpecificName>Libyan Skirmisher</SpecificName>
    <History>These men come from a vast variety of tribes; Adyrmachidae, Gilligammae, Asbystae, Cabalians, Aushisae, Ammonions, Nasamonions, Psylli, Garamantines, Lotophagi, Maceans, Machlyans, Atlantes, Atarantians, Auseans, Gyzantians, Maxyans, Zavecians and Masylies, to name but a few. Most Libyan tribes were remarked by ancient authors as fielding light skirmishers of some form. Libyan skirmishers were present in the war between Carthage and Agathocles in 310 BC as well as throughout the Punic Wars, noted in Hannibal’s army as skirmishing in front of the army in the initial engagement alongside Balearic skirmishers and slingers.</History>
