    <History>Fishing for the Carthaginians was much the same as it was for the Phoenicians from whom they were descended. Being primarily a sea power, fishing was one of Carthage’s primary means of food supply. The main fishing boat used was a medium sized (about 20 feet) row and sail boat.</History>
