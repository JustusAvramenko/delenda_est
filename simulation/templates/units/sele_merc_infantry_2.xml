    <History>Arabic mercenaries were recruited in vast numbers by the Syrian kings. At the Battle of Raphia in 217 BC, the army of Antiochus III had within it a contingent of 10,000 Arab troops. These men acted as a screen for the Seleucid war elephants and were ferocious fighters, but were of dubious reliability and effectiveness.</History>
