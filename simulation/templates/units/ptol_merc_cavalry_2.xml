	<SpecificName>Tarantine Cavalry</SpecificName>
    <History>Originally the cavalry of the army of the Greek city of Tarantas (Tarentum) in Magna Graecia, they were renowned for their peculiar battle tactics. It was the only cavalry of the Greco-Roman world to employ pure, advanced skirmishing tactics. It was unarmored and normally equipped with a shield and javelins, which it hurled at the enemy, evading any attempt to engage in close combat until all ammunition was exhausted. In the Hellenistic era, we have numerous references to Tarantine units, even in the armies of the eastern Macedonian empires, but unfortunately no definite account of their equipment or their tactical use. From the Greek tactical manuals we learn that Tarantines is the collective name of the lightly armored cavalry, which was equipped with javelins and lance, that first skirmishes with the enemy and then charges. From these texts, we can safely deduce that, during Hellenistic times, the term Tarantine no longer bore a geographical significance and was used purely as a tactical term.
