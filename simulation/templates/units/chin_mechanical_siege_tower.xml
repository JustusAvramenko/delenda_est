    <History>A variant of this tower 100m Chong Che called the "Cloud Bridge", protected with layers of cowhide along the sides was built. At the top were leather bags filled with water for dousing enemy fires. The tower was invulnerable to counterattacks until the defenders dug a large trench in front of the tower, to tip it over and had it burnt and destroyed.

	Jumping ahead to A.D. 1621, the rebel She Chongming laid siege to the Ming city of Chengdu with a 3m high Chong Che. This diminutive siege tower, a mere quarter the height of normal siege towers of the period, was more a siege "wall" than a siege tower since it was 150m wide. The Chong Che had two taller towers mounted at either end to overlook into the city, armoured with leather and held hundreds of soldiers within. The Ming defenders poured fire at this enemy monstrosity with catapults and only managed to stop the tower when their catapult stones frightened the oxen that were pulling the tower forward.

	The last recorded use of a Chong Che in Chinese military history must have been in A.D. 1851 when Taiping rebels besieged Guilin. Failing to storm the city with Yunti Che "Cloud ladders", they built a Chong Che as tall as the city walls, mounted cannons on it and bombarded the Qing soldiers manning the wall. However, the defenders finally destroyed the Chong Che with the use of boiling oil, and by burning the Chong Che with long poles wrapped with incendiary materials at the ends.</History>
